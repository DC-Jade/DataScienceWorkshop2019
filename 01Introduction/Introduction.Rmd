# The term no one really defined

- What is data science?

> Data science is the discipline of making data useful.  Ok...so what is it?

# Three tracks of data science

- Engineering: the process of making everything else possible

- Analysis: the process of turning raw information into insights in a fast way

- Modeling: the process of diving deeper into the data to discover the pattern we don't easily see


(It is a group work from https://github.com/happyrabbit/academic_advisory/blob/master/authors.md !)

# Engineering

(1) Data environment: data storage, Kafka platform, Hadoop and Spark cluster etc.

(2) Data management:   
Automated  is a common task which includes parsing the logs (depending on the stage of the company and the type of industry you are in), web scraping, API queries, and interrogating data streams. Determine and construct data schema to support analytical and modeling need. Use tools, processes, guidelines to ensure data is correct, standardized and documented.
(3) Production
If you want to integrate the model or analysis into the production system, then you have to automate all data handling steps. It involves the whole pipeline from data access to preprocessing, modeling and final deployment. It is necessary to make the system work smoothly with all existing stacks. So it requires to monitor the system through some sort of robust measures, such as rigorous error handling, fault tolerance, and graceful degradation to make sure the system is running smoothly and the users are happy.

# What can (should) data science do?

> - Make human better human by alleviating bounded rationality and minimize politics/emotion (rather than make machine more like human)

> - Strive for the “democratization” of data as legally possible: empower everyone in the organization to acquire, process, and leverage data in a timely and efficient fashion

# Types of Questions

- Comparison: 
    - Are males more inclined to buy our products than females?
    - Are there any differences in customer satisfaction in different business districts?
    - Do soybean carrying a particular gene have higher oil content?

- Description:
    - Is the distribution of annual income normal?
    - Are there outliers?
    - What are the means of different customer segments?

- Clustering:
    - Which customers have similar product preference? 
    - Which printer performs similar pattern to the broken ones?
    - How many different themes are there in the corpus?

# Types of Questions

- Classification:
    - Who is more likely to buy our product?
    -  Is the borrower going to pay back?
    -  Is it a spam?

- Regression:
    - What will be the temperature tomorrow?
    - What is the projected net income for the next season?
    - How much inventory should we have? 

# Types of Learning

- Supervised Learning
    - Input data labeled
    - Classification and regression

- Unsupervised Learning
    - Input data not labeled
    - Clustering

- Transfer Learning
